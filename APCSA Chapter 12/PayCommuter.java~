/*
Write the entire PayCommuter class which should extend the Commuter class. The class contains the following elements: a constant double variable FARE; a boolean variable paid; a constructor; and the methods described below.

The PayCommuter constructor should take two arguments, a String representing the name of the commuter, and a double representing the fare they must pay to commute.  In the constructor, set the name and FARE based on these arguments, and then set paid to false.

Write two accessors (getPaid and getFare), each simply returning their respective field values. Write a method called payFare that takes a double as an argument representing the paid fare. If the value is greater than the cost of the commute, set the paid variable to true. Write an overridden method for addMiles, checking to see if the commuter has paid his or her fare and then behaving like a typical Commuter and resetting the paid flag to false. Write an overridden method for toString which prints as shown below.

Ex. PayCommuter p = new PayCommuter("Robyn",1.25);

   System.out.println(p);     // "Robyn: 0 - Single ride: $1.25"
